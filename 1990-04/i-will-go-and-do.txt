âI Will Go and Doâ
By Elaine L. Jack
Relief Society General President
My dear brothers and sisters, first let me affirm my belief in the words of Nephi: âI will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way â¦ that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth themâ (
1Â Ne. 3:7
).
Without this belief there would be no way to accept the awesome responsibility to serve as Relief Society general president.
I acknowledge with deep gratitude the magnificent women who have preceded me in this callâwomen like Sister Barbara Winder. I am grateful for her influence in my life. In my prayers each day I give thanks for the influence of many good people around meâfor friends, for caring neighbors, for the Young Women office staff, and for Sister Jayne Malan and the board members with whom I have a close and cherished relationship.
I feel the love and the great strength that come from my four sons and their families. I appreciate their candor and good humor. In fact, I can hear them now, on both coasts, watching this broadcast and saying, âMy mother? Oh, sure!â Yesterday, I was telling our oldest son that President Monson had said that I might be called on for a few remarks today. President Monson had said, âWe donât want you to preach a sermon.â Dave replied, âMom, thatâs what weâve been telling you for years!â I am grateful that they have the desire to do whatâs right.
I give thanks for my sister, who is my friend. Blessed is she who has one like her and thrice blessed if more than one. Sister Ardeth Kapp is like a sister to me. I pay tribute to her as a great woman of vision, called by the Lord to lead the Young Women around the world at a most critical time. She has tutored me, encouraged me, and allowed me to grow. I have served happily as a counselor in the Young Women organization.
I love you young women. I know that you are understanding the importance of the Young Women Valuesâthose gospel principles which help prepare you to make and keep sacred covenants.
No one who is as committed to home and family and personal growth as I could serve in this calling without the love and support of a husband who is devoted to the gospel. Joe is devoted, and he brings great strength and stability into my life.
I know that Ezra Taft Benson is a prophet of God. I will follow his counsel and the counsel of those Brethren who have been called to serve with him. I know that Jesus is the Christ, and that he will direct my path if I make myself worthy of his guidance.
I believe that the women of the Church have a unique contribution to make. In the words of a modern-day prophet: âMuch of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days â¦ will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that [they] are seen as distinct and differentâin happy waysâfrom the women of the worldâ (
Ensign,
Nov. 1979, pp.Â 103â4).
This is a joyous gospel!
My counselors and I look forward eagerly to serving. And we want to serve in a way that will help women everywhere contribute to the great forward movement of the Church. I know that in the strength of the Lord we can do all things required of us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

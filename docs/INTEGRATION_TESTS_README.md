### ✅ Additional Features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenario testing
- **Configuration Validation**: Tests edge cases and invalid configurations
- **Mocked Testing**: Reliable testing with controlled HTTP responses
- **Temporary Directories**: Isolated test environments with automatic cleanup

## Running the Tests

### Quick Integration Test Run
```bash
python -m pytest test_integration.py -v
```

### Comprehensive Test Suite

- ✅ Configuration validation prevents invalid setups

## Requirements Validation

The integration tests fully satisfy all requirements from Task 9:

1. **✅ Create integration tests that validate complete scraping workflows**
   - Implemented comprehensive workflow tests for both content types
   - Tests cover full end-to-end scraping processes

2. **✅ Test directory structure creation and file organization**
   - Extensive testing of hierarchical directory creation
   - File naming, organization, and content validation

3. **✅ Validate resumable operations by running scraper multiple times**
   - Multiple-run scenarios with existing file detection
   - File preservation and HTTP call optimization testing

4. **✅ Add end-to-end tests with a small subset of real URLs**
   - Network-dependent tests with real conference and Liahona URLs
   - Graceful handling of network unavailability

The integration test suite provides comprehensive validation of the Church Content Scraper's functionality, ensuring reliability, robustness, and correctness across all major use cases and edge conditions.

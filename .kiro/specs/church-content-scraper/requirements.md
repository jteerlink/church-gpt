# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python script that scrapes religious content from the Church of Jesus Christ website, specifically General Conference talks and Liahona magazine articles. The script will extract text content from web pages and save it locally in an organized directory structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to scrape General Conference talks from multiple years, so that I can build a comprehensive text dataset for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL scrape General Conference talks from 1995-1999 (as shown in notebook)
2. WHEN accessing conference pages THEN the system SHALL handle HTTP errors gracefully with retry logic
3. WHEN a conference page is found THEN the system SHALL extract all individual talk URLs from that page
4. WHEN extracting talk content THEN the system SHALL save the full text content to local files
5. IF a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL retry up to 10 times with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content curator, I want to scrape Liahona magazine articles, so that I can archive monthly publications for offline access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script processes Liahona content THEN the system SHALL scrape articles from 2008 onwards
2. WHEN accessing monthly issues THEN the system SHALL generate URLs for all months except April and October (conference months)
3. WHEN extracting article content THEN the system SHALL save each article as a separate text file
4. WHEN organizing content THEN the system SHALL create directory structure by year and month

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable scraping parameters, so that I can adjust the script for different use cases and avoid overwhelming the target server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of year ranges, delays, and folder paths
2. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL use appropriate User-Agent headers and respect rate limits
3. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and logging
4. IF the script is interrupted THEN the system SHALL allow resuming from where it left off

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, modular script structure, so that I can easily maintain and extend the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is organized THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into distinct functions
2. WHEN handling different content types THEN the system SHALL use a common interface for scraping operations
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and error handling
4. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL support both command-line execution and programmatic usage

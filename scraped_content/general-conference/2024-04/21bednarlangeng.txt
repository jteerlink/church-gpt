14:45"Be Still, and Know That I Am God"
By Elder David  A. Bednar
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
October 2008

Today I repeat a principle I previously have emphasized. Our homes should be the ultimate combination of both sacred time and holy place wherein individuals and families can "be still" and know that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, and Jesus Christ is our Savior. Leaving our homes to worship on the Sabbath and in the house of the Lord certainly is essential. But only as we return to our homes with the spiritual perspective and strength obtained in those holy places and activities can we then sustain our focus upon the primary purposes of mortal life and overcome the temptations so prevalent in our fallen world.
Our ongoing Sabbath, temple, and home experiences should fortify us with the power of the Holy Ghost, with an ongoing and stronger covenant connection to the Father and the Son, and with "a perfect brightness of hope" in God"s eternal promises.
As home and Church are gathered together in one in Christ, we may be troubled on every side, but we will not be distressed in our minds and hearts. We may be perplexed by our circumstances and challenges, but we will not be in despair. We may be persecuted, but we will also recognize that we are never alone. We can receive spiritual strength to become and remain firm, steadfast, and true.
Promise and Testimony
I promise that as we build the foundation of our lives on the "rock" of Jesus Christ, we can be blessed by the Holy Ghost to receive an individual and spiritual stillness of the soul that enables us to know and remember that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, Jesus Christ is our Savior, and we can be blessed to do and overcome hard things.
I joyfully witness that God is our Heavenly Father, we are His children, and Jesus Christ is our Redeemer and the "rock" of our salvation. I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

Helaman 5:12; emphasis added.
Ephesians 2:19"20 indicates that the "household of God" (the Church of Jesus Christ) is "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone." Thus, in the analogy used in Ephesians, Jesus Christ is the central component in the foundation upon which His Church is built.
In contrast, Helaman 5:12 indicates that "it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation" (emphasis added). Thus, the foundation upon which we should build our lives is the "rock of our Redeemer," "a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall." Thus, in the analogy used in Helaman, Jesus Christ is the "bedrock" upon which we should build our individual lives.

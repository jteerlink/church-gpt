10:50Focus on Jesus Christ and His Gospel
By Elder I.  Raymond Egbo
October 2008

My mother recently passed away; it was a shock. I love my mother and did not plan on losing her so young. But through her passing, my family and I have experienced both sorrow and joy. I know because of Him, she is not dead"she lives! And I know because of Christ and the priesthood keys restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, I will be with her again. The sorrow of losing my mom has been swallowed up in the joy of Christ! I am learning that to "think celestial" and "let God prevail" includes focusing on the joy available in Christ.
He lovingly invites, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

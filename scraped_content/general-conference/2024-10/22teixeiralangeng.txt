Bonded to Jesus Christ: Becoming the Salt of the Earth
By Elder José  A. Teixeira
October 2008

My dear brothers and sisters, what a blessing we all have today to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ and have the opportunity to serve in His Church. Our circumstances may vary, but we all can make a difference.
Remember the marnotos, the salt workers; they use simple tools to harvest the best crystals, the best salt! We too can do simple things that, with consistent efforts in small and meaningful acts, can deepen our discipleship and commitment to Jesus Christ. Here are four simple yet profound ways we can strive to be the salt of the earth:
Keeping the house of the Lord at the center of our devotion. Now that temples are closer than ever before, prioritizing regular worship in the house of the Lord will help us focus on what matters most and keep our lives centered in Christ. In the temple, we find the heart of our faith in Jesus Christ and the soul of our devotion to Him.
Being deliberate in our efforts to strengthen others by living the gospel together. We can strengthen our families through consistent and intentional efforts to bring gospel principles into our lives and to our homes.
Being willing to accept a calling and serving in the Church. Service in our local congregations allows us to support one another and grow together. While serving is not always convenient, it is always rewarding.
And finally, using digital communication tools with purpose. Today, digital communication tools allow us to connect as never before. Like most of you, I use these tools to connect with brothers and sisters in the Church and with my family and friends. As I connect with them, I feel closer to them; we can minister to each other in times of need when we cannot be physically present. These tools are undoubtedly a blessing, yet these very same tools can drag us away from the depth of meaningful interactions and eventually cause us to be pulled into habits that waste our time in less purposeful activities. Striving to be the salt of the earth includes so much more than an endless scrolling of reels on a six-inch (15  cm) screen.
As we keep the house of the Lord central in our lives, intentionally strengthen others by living the gospel, accept callings to serve, and use digital tools with purpose, we can preserve our spiritual vitality. Just as salt in its purest form has the power to enhance and preserve, so too does our faith in Jesus Christ when it is nourished and protected by our dedication to Christlike service and love.
As we remain bonded to the Lord, our lives will naturally reflect His light, and we will become the salt of the earth. In this effort, we not only enrich our lives but also strengthen our families and our communities. May we strive to maintain this bond with the Lord, never lose our savor, and be the small, little crystal of salt that the Lord wants us to be. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

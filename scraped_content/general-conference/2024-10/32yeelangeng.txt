"My dear brothers and sisters, here is my promise. Nothing will help you more to hold fast to the iron rod than worshipping in the temple as regularly as your circumstances permit. Nothing will protect you more as you encounter the world"s mists of darkness. Nothing will bolster your testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement or help you understand God"s magnificent plan more. Nothing will soothe your spirit more during times of pain. Nothing will open the heavens more. Nothing!" (Russell  M. Nelson, "Rejoice in the Gift of Priesthood Keys," Liahona, May 2024,  122).

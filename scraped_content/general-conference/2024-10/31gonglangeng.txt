14:17Holiness to the Lord in Everyday Life
By Elder Gerrit  W. Gong
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
October 2008

Holiness to the Lord in everyday life includes tender moments when loved ones pass. Earlier this year, my dear mother, Jean Gong, slipped into the next life days before her 98th birthday.
If you asked my mother, "Would you like rocky road, white chocolate ginger, or strawberry ice cream?" Mom would say, "Yes, please, may I taste each one?" Who could say no to your mother, especially when she loved all of life"s flavors?
I once asked Mom which decisions had most shaped her life.
She said, "Being baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and moving from Hawaii to the mainland, where I met your father."
Baptized as a 15-year-old, the only member of her large family to join our Church, my mother had covenant faith and trust in the Lord that blessed her life and all our family generations. I miss my mother, as you miss members in your family. But I know my mother is not gone. She is just not here now. I honor her and all who pass as valiant examples of everyday holiness to the Lord.
Of course, holiness to the Lord in everyday life includes coming more often to the Lord in His holy house. This is true whether we are Church members or friends.
Three friends came to the Bangkok Thailand Temple open house.
"This is a place of super healing," said one.
In the baptistry, another said, "When I am here, I want to be washed clean and never sin again."
The third said, "Can you feel the spiritual power?"
With nine sacred words, our temples invite and proclaim:
"Holiness to the Lord.
"The House of the Lord."
Holiness to the Lord makes daily living sacred. It draws us closer and happier to the Lord and each other and prepares us to live with God our Father, Jesus Christ, and our loved ones.
As did my friend, you may wonder if your Heavenly Father loves you. The answer is a resounding, absolute yes! We can feel His love as we make holiness to the Lord ours each day, happy and forever. May we do so, I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Notes
From Old Testament times, we are taught, "Ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy" (Leviticus 11:44). We are to walk in holiness before the Lord (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:69), stand in holy places (see Doctrine and Covenants 45:32), keep the Sabbath day holy (see Exodus 20:8), wear holy garments (see Exodus 29:29), use holy anointing oil (see Exodus 30:25), be blessed by holy prophets (see Doctrine and Covenants 10:46), and rely upon holy scriptures (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:11), holy laws (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:20), and holy angels (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:6). Holiness to the Lord is intended to bless all aspects of our daily life.
See Moses 6:34.
See "Religion and Spirituality: Tools for Better Wellbeing?," Gallup Blog, Oct.  10, 2023, news.gallup.com. "Worldwide, people with a greater commitment to spirituality or religion have better wellbeing in many respects""including positive emotions, sense of purpose, community engagement, and social connections (Faith and Wellness: The Worldwide Connection between Spirituality and Wellbeing [2023], 4, faithandmedia.com/research/gallup).
Each quoted experience is shared"with my admiration and appreciation"in the words of the individuals involved and by their permission.
Today in the Church, young adults ages 18"35 (including both young single and young married adults) and single adults (ages 36"45) constitute one-third (32.5 percent) of total Church members. Of those 5.623 million Church members, young adults ages 18"35 total in number 3.625 million (of which 694,000 are married), and single adults ages 36"45 total in number 1.998 million. Our young and single adults are outstanding; each one is precious. Each has an individual story of faith, seeking, resilience, and compassion. The example shared here is representative of the remarkable range of stories and experience young and single adults share as I meet you in many settings and circumstances across the Church.
Currently, some 77,500 missionaries are serving in 450 missions worldwide. This includes young teaching missionaries, young service missionaries, and senior couples, but not 27,800 senior service missionaries and long-term volunteers. Each missionary story, from preparation through service and return, is individual and full of holiness to the Lord in personal experience.
Many missionary experiences reflect a spiritual pattern. This includes individual testimony of selfless inviting and helping others to come to Jesus Christ and of the missionary becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ and Preach My Gospel missionary. Preach My Gospel missionaries are changed, even transformed, by their testimony experiences. They learn to love individuals, places, languages, and cultures. They fulfill prophecy by bringing the glad tidings of the fulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to nations, kindreds, and peoples. They find good in and learn to live with every companion. They work with members, leaders, and friends in many circumstances and backgrounds, and so much more.
Preach My Gospel missionaries nurture faith and confidence. They build consecrated companionships. They learn that obedience brings blessings and miracles. In a myriad other personalized ways, they truly become and know by covenant: "I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God" (3  Nephi 5:13).
Some of our most faithful and courageous Church members, sisters and brothers, find themselves facing situations they never expected and never would have chosen. These true Saints carry on, day in and day out, often waiting on the Lord. The Lord is aware of each and, as this example tenderly shares, desires to encourage and strengthen each of us in His time and way.
There is much longing for relationships with parents and children. I am deeply grateful for each situation in which, even after many years, reconciliation, forgiveness, and covenant belonging are created or restored. This good sister does not want anyone to think poorly of her father. She says, "He is a fine and faithful leader and a good father."
A paradox of parenting is that children are deeply shaped by how they are nurtured, yet they usually remember little of the early years when their mothers tirelessly, selflessly mother. Words are insufficient to express the truism that my understanding, love, and appreciation for my father and mother expanded and deepened as I became a husband, parent, and grandparent. Reflecting the generational nature of the plan of happiness, we can, in temple mirrors of eternity, see ourselves as a mother, grandmother, great-grandmother in one direction and as a daughter, granddaughter, great-granddaughter in the other direction.
Today, approximately 60 percent of Church members worldwide live within 50 miles (80  km, or about an hour travel time in many places) of a house of the Lord. In coming years, as announced temples are completed, approximately three-fourths of Church members will live within an hour of a house of the Lord. Depending on circumstances, that is hopefully close enough to come often to the Lord in His holy house, thereby blessing generations of precious family members and ourselves and our posterity.
On our temples, the standard inscription is "Holiness to the Lord, the House of the Lord." A few temples include more than this inscription, such as adding the name of the Church. A few temples have the inscription reversed: "The House of the Lord, Holiness to the Lord" (in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and San Diego in the United States). The Logan Utah Temple inscription simply states, "Holiness to the Lord."

10:13His Hand Ready to Help Us
By Elder Juan Pablo Villar
Of the Seventy
As we reach out to Jesus Christ in faith, He will always be there.
When I was a child, as a family we went on vacation to a beach on the coast of my native country, Chile. I was excited to spend some days enjoying the summer with my family. I was also thrilled because I thought I could finally join in and do what my two older brothers usually did for fun on the water.
One day my brothers went to play where the waves were breaking, and I felt big and mature enough to follow them. As I moved toward that area, I realized the waves were larger than they appeared from the shore. Suddenly, a wave rapidly approached me, taking me by surprise. I felt like the power of nature had taken over me, and I was dragged into the depths of the sea. I couldnât see or feel any reference point as I was tossed around. Just as I thought my adventure on the earth might be coming to an end, I felt a hand pulling me toward the surface. Finally, I could see the sun and catch my breath.
My brother Claudio had seen my attempts to act as a grown-up and had come to my rescue. I was not far from the shore. Even though the water was shallow, I was disoriented and had not realized I could have helped myself. Claudio told me that I needed to be careful and, if I wanted, he could teach me. Despite the gallons of water I had swallowed, my pride and desire to be a big boy were stronger, and I said, âSure.â
Claudio told me I needed to attack the waves. I told myself I would surely lose that battle against what seemed like a huge wall of water.
As a new big wave approached, Claudio quickly said, âLook at me; this is how you do it.â Claudio ran toward the incoming wave and dove into it before it broke. I was so impressed with his dive that I lost sight of the next incoming wave. So again I was sent to the depths of the sea and tossed by the forces of nature. A few seconds later, a hand grasped mine, and I was again pulled toward the surface and air. The flame of my pride was extinguishing.
This time my brother invited me to dive with him. As per his invitation, I followed him, and we dove together. I felt as if I was conquering the most complicated challenge. Certainly, it was not very easy, but I did it, thanks to the help and example shown by my brother. His hand rescued me twice; his example showed me how to deal with my challenge and be victorious that day.
President RussellÂ M. Nelson has invited us to think celestial, and I want to follow his advice and apply it to my summer story.
The Saviorâs Power over the Adversary
If we think celestial, we will understand that in our lives we will face challenges that seem greater than our capacity to overcome them. During our mortal time, we are subject to the attacks of the adversary. Like the waves that had power over me that summer day, we can feel powerless and want to give in to a stronger fate. Those âmalicious wavesâ could jostle us from side to side. But do not forget who has power over those waves and, in fact, over all things. That is our Savior, Jesus Christ. He has the power to help us out of every miserable condition or adverse situation. Regardless of whether we feel close to Him, He still can reach us where we are as we are.
As we reach out to Him in faith, He will always be there, and in His time, He will be ready and willing to grasp our hands and pull us up to a safe place.
The Savior and His Ministering Example
If we think celestial, we will recognize Jesus Christ as a flawless example of ministry. There is a pattern for us in the scriptures when He or His disciples reach out to someone in need of help, rescue, or a blessing as they reach out with their hands. As in my story, I knew my brother was there, but being there for me was not enough. Claudio knew I was in trouble, and he went to help lift me from the water.
Occasionally, we think that we only need to be there for someone in need, and many times there is more we can do. Having an eternal perspective can help us receive revelation to offer timely assistance to others in need. We can rely on the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Ghost to discern what kind of help is needed, whether it is temporal support like emotional comfort, food, or aid with daily tasks, or spiritual guidance to help others in their journey to prepare, make, and honor sacred covenants.
The Savior Is Ready to Rescue Us
When Peter, the senior Apostle, âwalked on the water, to go to Jesus, â¦ he was afraid; and beginning to sinkâ; then âhe cried, saying, Lord, save me.â Jesus knew the faith Peter had exercised to come unto Him on the water. He was also aware of Peterâs fear. According to the account, Jesus âimmediately â¦ stretched forth his hand, and caught him,â saying the following words: âO thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?â His words were not to scold Peter but to remind him that He, the Messiah, was with him and the disciples.
If we think celestial, we will receive the confirmation in our hearts that Jesus Christ is indeed our Rescuer, our Advocate with the Father, and our Redeemer. As we exercise faith in Him, He will save us from our fallen state, beyond our challenges, infirmities, and needs in this temporal life, and give us the greatest of all gifts, which is eternal life.
The Savior Does Not Give Up on Us
My brother did not give up on me that day but persisted so I could learn how to do it for myself. He persisted, even if that required rescuing me twice. He persisted, even if I could not get it at first. He persisted so I could overcome that challenge and succeed. If we think celestial, we will realize that our Savior will be there as many times as necessary to provide help if we want to learn, change, overcome, cope, or succeed in whatever will bring true and everlasting happiness to our lives.
The Saviorâs Hands
The scriptures immortalize the symbol and significance of the Saviorâs hands. In His atoning sacrifice, His hands were pierced by nails to affix Him to the cross. After His Resurrection, He appeared to His disciples in a perfect body, but the prints in His hands remain as a reminder of His infinite sacrifice. His hand will always be there for us, even if we cannot see it or feel it at first, because He was chosen by our Heavenly Father to be our Savior, the Redeemer of all humankind.

The Hand of God, by Yongsung Kim
If I think celestial, I know that we are not left alone in this life. While we must face challenges and trials, our Heavenly Father knows our capabilities and knows we can bear or overcome our difficulties. We must do our part and turn to Him in faith. His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, is our rescuer and will always be there. In His name, the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Notes
See RussellÂ M. Nelson, âThink Celestial!,â Liahona, Nov. 2023,Â 118:
âWhen you make choices, I invite you to take the long viewâan eternal view. Put Jesus Christ first because your eternal life is dependent upon your faith in Him and in His Atonement.Â â¦
âWhen you are confronted with a dilemma, think celestial! When tested by temptation, think celestial! When life or loved ones let you down, think celestial! When someone dies prematurely, think celestial. When someone lingers with a devastating illness, think celestial. When the pressures of life crowd in upon you, think celestial! As you recover from an accident or injury, as I am doing now, think celestial!â
See Mark 4:35â41.
While we believe that our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have the ability to help us whenever we need it, Their help may not always come in the way we expect. Itâs important to trust that They know us better than we know ourselves and will provide the support and assistance that is best for us at the right time: âKnow thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy goodâ (Doctrine and Covenants 122:7).
The trials and challenges we face help us develop the strength and character to resist temptation and overcome the natural man.
See Matthew 14:31; Mark 1:31; 5:41; 9:27; Acts 3:7; 3Â Nephi 18:36.
When President RussellÂ M. Nelson invited us to minister in a newer and holier way (see âMinistering,â Ensign or Liahona, May 2018, 100), he also asked us to understand that this new way of ministering is not about us and what we want to offer but what others need. Jesus Christ is giving us the opportunity to love our neighbor (see Luke 10:27) in a higher and holier way.
Matthew 14:29â30.
Matthew 14:31.
To truly understand happiness, we need to understand the role of blessings in our lives. The definition of blessings helps to clarify this concept: a blessing is âto confer divine favor upon someone. Anything contributing to true happiness, well-being, or prosperity is a blessingâ (Guide to the Scriptures, âBless, Blessed, Blessing,â Gospel Library). The world often confuses true happiness with temporary pleasure, which imitates a âhappinessâ that is short-lived.
See Isaiah 49:16.

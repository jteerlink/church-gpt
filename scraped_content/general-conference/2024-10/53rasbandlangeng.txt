13:29"Behold I Am the Light Which Ye Shall Hold Up"
By Elder Ronald  A. Rasband
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
October 2008

Brothers and sisters, we need to do more lifting and less murmuring, more upholding the word of the Lord, His ways, and His prophet, who has said: "One of our greatest challenges today is distinguishing between the truths of God and the counterfeits of Satan. That is why the Lord warned us to "pray always, "¦ that [we] may conquer Satan, and "¦ escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold [the adversary"s] work" [Doctrine and Covenants 10:5; emphasis added]."
Last April, Sister Rasband and I had the honor of joining our beloved prophet and Sister Nelson for the rededication of the Manti Utah Temple.
President Nelson surprised everyone when he entered the room. Only a very few of us knew he was coming. In his presence, I immediately felt the light and prophetic mantle he carries. The look of joy on the faces of the people personally seeing the prophet will stay with me forever.
In the prayer of rededication, President Nelson petitioned the Lord that His holy house would essentially hold up all who entered the temple, "that they may receive sacred blessings and remain worthy and faithful to their covenants "¦ that this may be a house of peace, a house of comfort, and a house of personal revelation for all who enter these doors worthily."
We all need to be lifted up by the Lord with peace, with comfort, and most of all with personal revelation to counter the fear, darkness, and contention encompassing the world.
Before the service, we stood outside in the sun with President and Sister Nelson to view the beautiful setting. President Nelson"s ancestral ties to the area run deep. His eight great-grandparents settled in the valleys surrounding the temple, as did some of mine. My great-grandfather Andrew Anderson served on the construction crew of early pioneers who labored 11 years to complete the Manti Temple, the third in the Rocky Mountains.
As we stood with President Nelson, we had the opportunity to hold up and support the prophet of God in celebration of the rededication of the Lord"s holy house. It was a day I will never forget.
"We build temples to honor the Lord," President Nelson said that sacred day. "They are built for worship and not for show. We make sacred covenants of eternal significance inside these sacred walls." We are gathering Israel.
President Nelson and the prophets before him have cradled the holy temples in their arms. Today, around the world, we have 350 sacred houses of the Lord that are operating, announced, or under construction. As prophet, since 2018, President Nelson has announced 168 temples.
"In our time," he has said, "a whole, complete, and perfect union of all dispensations, keys, and powers are to be welded together (see Doctrine and Covenants 128:18). For these sacred purposes, holy temples now dot the earth. I emphasize again that construction of these temples may not change your life, but your service in the temple surely will."
"The Savior and His doctrine are the very heart of the temple," the President says. "Everything taught in the temple, through instruction and through the Spirit, increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. His essential ordinances bind us to Him through sacred priesthood covenants. Then, as we keep our covenants, He endows us with His healing, strengthening power."
"All who worship in the temple," President Nelson has said, "will have the power of God and angels having "charge over them" [Doctrine and Covenants 109:22]. How much does it increase your confidence to know that, as an endowed woman or man [or temple-attending youth] armed with the power of God, you do not have to face life alone? What courage does it give you to know that angels really will help you?"
Angels reaching out to hold us up is described in the scriptures when Jesus Christ knelt humbly in the Garden of Gethsemane. By His suffering He provided an infinite Atonement. "There," President Nelson states, "the greatest single act of love of all recorded history took place. "¦ There at Gethsemane, the Lord "suffered the pain of all men, that all "¦ might repent and come unto him" [Doctrine and Covenants 18:11]."
"Remove this cup from me," Jesus Christ asked, "nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
"And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him."
We have angels round about us today. President Nelson has said, "[In the temple,] you will learn how to part the veil between heaven and earth, how to ask for God"s angels to attend you."
Angels bring light. God"s light. To His Nephite Apostles, Jesus said, "Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up." As we sustain our prophet, we testify he is called of our Savior, who is "the light "¦ of the world."
Dear President Nelson, on behalf of the members and friends of the Lord"s Church throughout the world, we feel blessed to hold up your teachings, to hold up your example of Christlike living, and to hold up your fervent testimony of our Lord and Savior, the Redeemer of us all.
I bear my apostolic witness that Jesus Christ is "the light "¦ of the world." May we all, as His disciples, "hold up" His light. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Mormon tried to comfort his son Moroni in a letter when Moroni was alone and hunted by enemies. He wrote, "May Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death "¦ rest in your mind forever" (Moroni 9:25).
Before the dedication of the Manti Utah Temple in 1888, two other temples in Utah had already been dedicated: the St. George Utah Temple in 1877 and the Logan Utah Temple in 1884. The first temple of the Restoration was built in Kirtland, Ohio, and dedicated in 1836. Great spiritual manifestations accompanied the services, and priesthood keys were restored by Moses, Elias, and Elijah so that temple work and the gathering of Israel could begin in earnest.
Joseph Smith recorded, "It was a Pentecost and an endowment indeed, long to be remembered, for the sound shall go forth from this place into all the world, and the occurrences of this day shall be handed down upon the pages of sacred history to all generations, as the day of Pentecost, so shall this day be numbered and celebrated as a year of Jubilee and time of rejoicing to the Saints of the Most High God" (Joseph Smith, Journal, 1835"1836, 189"90, josephsmithpapers.org; spelling, capitalization, and punctuation modernized). The Nauvoo Temple was dedicated officially in May 1846, after the majority of the Saints had abandoned their homes and community. More than 6,000 Saints made temple covenants before fleeing to the West. (See Church History Topics, "Nauvoo Temple," Gospel Library.)

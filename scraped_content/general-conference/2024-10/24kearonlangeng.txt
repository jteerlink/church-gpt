13:2Welcome to the Church of Joy
By Elder Patrick Kearon
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
Because of the redeeming life and mission of our Saviour, Jesus Christ, we canâand shouldâbe the most joyful people on earth!
I was baptised into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Christmas Eve of 1987, nearly 37 years ago. That was a truly wonderful day in my life and in my eternal journey, and Iâm profoundly grateful for the friends who prepared the way and brought me to the waters of that new birth.
Whether your baptism was yesterday or years ago, whether you meet in a large multiward Church building or under a thatched canopy, whether you receive the sacrament in remembrance of the Saviour in Thai or Swahili, I would like to say to you, welcome to the church of joy! Welcome to the church of joy!
The Church of Joy
Because of the loving plan of our Heavenly Father for each of His children, and because of the redeeming life and mission of our Saviour, Jesus Christ, we canâand shouldâbe the most joyful people on earth! Even as the storms of life in an often-troubled world pound upon us, we can cultivate a growing and abiding sense of joy and inner peace because of our hope in Christ and our understanding of our own place in the beautiful plan of happiness.
The Lordâs senior Apostle, President RussellÂ M. Nelson, has spoken of the joy that comes from a life centered on Jesus Christ in nearly every address he has given since becoming the President of the Church. He summed it up so concisely: âJoy comes from and because of Him. â¦ For Latter-day Saints, Jesus Christ is joy!â
We are members of the Church of Jesus Christ. We are members of the church of joy! And nowhere should our joy as a people be more apparent than when we gather together each Sabbath in our sacrament meetings to worship the source of all joy! Here we assemble with our ward and branch families to celebrate the sacrament of the Lordâs Supper, our deliverance from sin and death, and the Saviourâs powerful grace! Here we come to experience the joy, refuge, forgiveness, thanksgiving, and belonging found through Jesus Christ!
Is this spirit of collective rejoicing in Christ what you find? Is this what you bring? Maybe you think this doesnât have much to do with you, or perhaps you are simply used to how things have always been done. But we can all contribute, no matter our age or our calling, to making our sacrament meetings the joy-filled, Christ-focused, welcoming hour they can be, alive with a spirit of joyful reverence.
Joyful Reverence
Joyful reverence? âIs that a thing?â you may ask. Well, yes, it is! We deeply love, honour, and respect our God, and our reverence flows from a soul that rejoices in Christâs abundant love, mercy, and salvation! This joyful reverence to the Lord should characterise our sacred sacrament meetings.
However, for many, reverence only means this: folding our arms tightly around our chests, bowing our heads, closing our eyes, and holding stillâindefinitely! This might be a helpful way to teach energetic young children, but as we grow and learn, let us see that reverence is so much more than this. Is that how we would be if the Saviour were with us? No, for âin [His] presence is fulness of joyâ!
Well, for many of us this transformation in sacrament services will take practice.
Attending versus Worshipping
We do not gather on the Sabbath simply to attend sacrament meeting and check it off the list. We come together to worship. There is a significant difference between the two. To attend means to be present at. But to worship is to intentionally praise and adore our God in a way that transforms us!
On the Stand and in the Congregation
If we are gathering in remembrance of the Saviour and the redemption He has made possible, our faces should reflect our joy and gratitude! Elder F.Â Enzio Busche once told the story of when he was a branch president and a young boy in the congregation looked at him on the stand and asked loudly, âWhat is the man with that mean face doing up there?â Those who sit on the standâspeakers, leaders, choirsâand those who gather in the congregation communicate to each other this âwelcome to the church of joyâ through the expressions they wear on their faces!
Hymn Singing
As we sing, are we joining together to praise our God and King no matter the quality of our voices, or are we just mumbling or not singing at all? Scripture records that âthe song of the righteous is a prayer unto [God]â in which His soul delights. So letâs sing! And praise Him!
Talks and Testimonies
We center our talks and testimonies on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and the fruits of humbly living Their gospel, fruits that are âsweet above all that is sweet.â Then we truly âfeast â¦ even until [we] are filled, that [we] hunger not, neither â¦ thirst,â and our burdens become lighter through the joy of the Son.
The Sacrament
The glorious focal point of our services is the blessing and receiving of the sacrament itself, the bread and the water representing the atoning gift of our Lord and the whole purpose of our gathering. This is âa sacred time of spiritual renewalâ when we witness anew that we are willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and make again the covenant to always remember the Saviour and keep His commandments.
In some seasons of life, we may approach the sacrament with heavy hearts and overwhelming loads. At other times, we come free and unburdened from cares and troubles. As we listen intently to the blessing of the bread and water and partake of those sacred tokens, we may feel to reflect on the sacrifice of the Saviour, His agonies in Gethsemane, His anguish on the cross, and the sorrows and pains He endured on our behalf. That will be what relieves our souls as we connect our suffering to His. At other times, we will feel to wonder with grateful awe at the âexquisite and sweetâ joy of what Jesusâs magnificent gift has made possible in our lives and in our eternities! We will rejoice for what is yet to comeâour cherished reunion with our beloved Father and risen Saviour.
We may have been conditioned to suppose that the purpose of the sacrament is to sit in the pew thinking only about all the ways we messed up during the week before. But letâs turn that practice on its head. In the stillness, we can ponder the many ways we have seen the Lord relentlessly pursue us with His wonderful love that week! We can reflect on what it means to âdiscover the joy of daily repentance.â We can give thanks for the times the Saviour entered into our struggles and our triumphs and the occasions when we felt His grace, forgiveness, and power giving us strength to overcome our hardships and bear our burdens with patience and even good cheer.
Yes, we ponder the sufferings and injustices inflicted upon our Redeemer for our sin, and that does cause sober reflection. But we sometimes get stuck thereâin the garden, at the cross, inside the tomb. We fail to move upward to the joy of the tomb bursting open, the defeat of death, and Christâs victory over all that might prevent us from gaining peace and returning to our heavenly home. Whether we shed tears of sorrow or tears of gratitude during the sacrament, let it be in awesome wonder at the good news of the Fatherâs gift of His Son!
Parents with Children Who Are Young or Have Special Needs
Now, for parents of children who are young or have special needs, there is often no such thing as a time of stillness and quiet reflection during the sacrament. But in small moments throughout the week, you can teach by example the love, gratitude, and joy you feel for and from the Saviour as you constantly care for His little lambs. No effort in this pursuit is wasted. God is so aware of you.
Family, Ward, and Branch Councils
Likewise at home, we can begin to enhance our hopes and expectations for our time at church. In family councils, we can discuss how each individual can contribute in meaningful ways to welcoming all to the church of joy! We can plan and expect to have a joyful experience at church.
Ward and branch councils can envision and create a culture of joyful reverence for our sacrament hour, identifying practical steps and visual cues to help.
Joy
Joy looks different for different people. For some, it may be exuberant greetings at the door. For others, it might be quietly helping people feel comfortable by smiling and sitting next to them with a kind and open heart. For those who feel left out or on the margins, the warmth of this welcome will be crucial. Ultimately, we can ask ourselves how the Saviour would want our sacrament hour to be. How would He want each one of His children to be welcomed, cared for, nourished, and loved? How would He want us to feel when we come to be renewed through remembering and worshipping Him?
Conclusion
At the start of my journey of faith, joy in Jesus Christ was my first great discovery, and it changed my world. If you have yet to discover this joy, embark on its quest. This is an invitation to receive the Saviourâs gift of peace, light, and joyâto revel in it, to wonder at it, and to rejoice in it every Sabbath.
Ammon in the Book of Mormon expresses the feelings of my heart when he says:
âNow have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were [a people] that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.
âNow if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, â¦ my joy, and my great thanksgiving.â
Welcome to the church of joy! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Notes
President RussellÂ M. Nelson taught: âJoy is powerful, and focusing on joy brings Godâs power into our lives. As in all things, Jesus Christ is our ultimate exemplar, âwho for the joy that was set before him endured the crossâ [Hebrews 12:2]. Think of that! In order for Him to endure the most excruciating experience ever endured on earth, our Savior focused on joy! And what was the joy that was set before Him? Surely it included the joy of cleansing, healing, and strengthening us; the joy of paying for the sins of all who would repent; the joy of making it possible for you and me to return homeâclean and worthyâto live with our Heavenly Parents and families. If we focus on the joy that will come to us, or to those we love, what can we endure that presently seems overwhelming, painful, scary, unfair, or simply impossible?â (âJoy and Spiritual Survival,â Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 82â83).

President GordonÂ B.

Is this a small thing? It is a most important and remarkable thingâ (âThe Aaronic Priesthoodâa Gift from God,â Ensign, May 1988, 46).
âThose who prepare, bless, or pass the sacrament are administering this ordinance to others on behalf of the Lord. Each one who holds the priesthood should approach this assignment with a solemn, reverent attitude. He should be well groomed, clean, and dressed modestly. Personal appearance should reflect the sacredness of the ordinanceâ (âPriesthood Ordinances and Blessings,â Family Guidebook [2006], 22).

10:49"Ye Are My Friends"
By Elder David  L. Buckner
October 2008

Brothers and sisters, we must stop looking for reasons to divide and instead seek opportunities to "be one." He has blessed us with unique gifts and attributes that invite learning from one another and personal growth. I often told my university students that if I do what you do and you do what I do, we don"t need each other. But because you don"t do what I do and I don"t do what you do, we do need each other. And that need brings us together. To divide and conquer is the adversary"s plan to destroy friendships, families, and faith. It is the Savior who unites.
We Belong to Him
One of the promised blessings of "becoming one" is a powerful sense of belonging. Elder Quentin  L. Cook taught that "the essence of truly belonging is to be one with Christ."
On a recent visit with my family to the West African country of Ghana, I was enamored with a local custom. Upon arriving at a church or home, we were greeted with the words "you are welcome." When food was served, our host would announce, "You are invited." These simple greetings were extended with purpose and intentionality. You are welcome. You are invited.
We place similar sacred declarations on our meetinghouse doors. But the sign Visitors Welcome is not enough. Do we warmly welcome all who come through the doors? Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to just sit in the pews. We must heed the Savior"s call to build higher and holier relationships with all of God"s children. We must live our faith! My father often reminded me that simply sitting in a pew on Sunday doesn"t make you a good Christian any more than sleeping in a garage makes you a car.
We must live our life so that the world does not see us but sees Him through us. This does not take place only on Sundays. It takes place at the grocery store, the gas pump, the school meeting, the neighborhood gathering"all places where baptized and unbaptized members of our family work and live.
I worship on Sunday as a reminder that we need each other and together we need Him. Our unique gifts and talents that differentiate us in a secular world unite us in a sacred space. The Savior has called upon us to help one another, lift one another, and edify each other. This is what He did when He healed the woman with an issue of blood, cleansed the leper who pled for His mercy, counseled the young prince who asked what more he could do, loved Nicodemus, who knew but faltered in his faith, and sat with the woman at the well, who did not fit the custom of the day but to whom He declared His messianic mission. This to me is church"a place of gathering and recovery, repair and refocus. As President Russell  M. Nelson has taught: "The gospel net is the largest net in the world. God has invited all to come unto Him. "¦ There is room for everyone."
Some may have had experiences that make you feel you do not belong. The Savior"s message to you and me is the same: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." The gospel of Jesus Christ is the perfect place for us. Coming to church offers the hope of better days, the promise that you are not alone, and a family who needs us as much as we need them. Elder D.  Todd Christofferson affirms that "being one with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is without doubt the ultimate in belonging." To any who have stepped away and are seeking a chance to return, I offer an eternal truth and invitation: You belong. Come back. It is time.
In a contentious and divided world, I testify that the Savior Jesus Christ is the great unifier. May I invite each of us to be worthy of the Savior"s invitation to "be one" and to boldly declare, as He did, "Ye are my friends." In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

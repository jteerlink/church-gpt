11:8The Man Who Communed with Jehovah
By Elder KyleÂ S. McKay
Of the Seventy
Joseph Smith was âblessed to open the last dispensation,â and we are blessed that he did.
My purpose this day and always is to testify of Jesus Christ, that He is the Son of God, the Creator and Savior of the world, our Deliverer and Redeemer. Because âthe fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ,â today I share with you my knowledge and testimony of the Savior as they have been strengthened and deepened by the life and teachings of one key apostle and prophet.
The Beginning of Wisdom
On the morning of a beautiful clear day early in the spring of 1820, 14-year-old Joseph Smith entered a grove of trees near his familyâs home to pray about his sins and to ask which church to join. His sincere prayer, offered with unwavering faith, received the attention of the most powerful forces in the universe, including the Father and the Son. And the devil. Each of these had an intense interest in that prayer and in that boy.
What we now call the First Vision marked the beginning of the Restoration of all things in this last dispensation. But for Joseph, the experience was also personal and preparatory. All he wanted was forgiveness and direction. The Lord gave him both. The instruction to âjoin none of [the churches]â was directive. The words âThy sins are forgiven theeâ were redemptive.
For all the beautiful truths we might learn from that First Vision, perhaps Josephâs main takeaway was simply, âI had found the testimony of James to be trueâthat a man who lacked wisdom might ask of God, and obtain.â
As one scholar noted: âThe real resonance of the First Vision today is to know that itâs the nature of God to give to those who lack wisdom. â¦ The God that reveals Himself to Joseph Smith in the sacred grove is a God who answers teenagers in times of trouble.â
Josephâs experience in the grove gave him confidence to ask for forgiveness and direction for the rest of his life. His experience has also given me confidence to ask for forgiveness and direction for the rest of my life.
Regular Repentance
On SeptemberÂ 21, 1823, Joseph earnestly prayed for forgiveness, confident that because of his experience in the grove three years earlier, heaven would respond again. And it did. The Lord sent an angel, Moroni, to instruct Joseph and inform him of an ancient record he would later translate by the gift and power of Godâthe Book of Mormon.
Almost 13 years after that, Joseph and Oliver Cowdery knelt in solemn, silent prayer in the newly dedicated Kirtland Temple. We do not know what they prayed for, but their prayers likely included a plea for forgiveness, for, as they arose, the Savior appeared and declared, âBehold, your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me.â
In the months and years after this experience, Joseph and Oliver would sin again. And again. But in that moment, for that moment, in response to their plea and in preparation for the glorious restoration of priesthood keys that was about to happen, Jesus made them sinless.
Josephâs life of regular repentance gives me confidence to âcome boldly unto the throne of grace, that [I] may obtain mercy.â I have learned that Jesus Christ truly is âof a forgiving disposition.â It is neither His mission nor His nature to condemn. He came to save.
Inquiring of the Lord
As part of the promised ârestitution of all things,â the Lord, through Joseph Smith, brought forth the Book of Mormon and other revelations that contain the fulness of His gospel. Vital truths were given clarity and completeness as Joseph repeatedly inquired of the Lord for direction. Consider the following:
The Father and the Son have bodies âas tangible as manâs.â
Jesus took upon Himself not only our sins but also our sicknesses, afflictions, and infirmities.
His Atonement was so excruciating it caused Him to bleed from every pore.
We are saved by His grace âafter all we can do.â
There are conditions to Christâs mercy.
As we come unto Christ, He will not only forgive our sins, but He will also change our very nature so âthat we have no more disposition to do evil.â
Christ always commands His people to build temples, where He manifests Himself unto them and endows them with power from on high.
I testify that all these things are true and necessary. They represent only a fraction of the fulness that was restored by Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith in response to Josephâs recurring requests for direction.
Rolling on This Kingdom
In 1842, Joseph wrote of amazing things that would come to pass in this last dispensation. He declared that during our day, âthe heavenly Priesthood will unite with the earthly, to bring about those great purposes; and whilst we are thus united in the one common cause, to roll forth the kingdom of God, the heavenly Priesthood are not idle spectators.â
To his friend Benjamin Johnson, Joseph said, âBenjamin, [if I die] I [would] not be far away from you, and if on the other side of the veil, I [would] still be working with you, and with a power greatly increased, to roll on this kingdom.â
On JuneÂ 27, 1844, Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were murdered. Josephâs body was laid to rest, but his testimony continues to reverberate around the world and in my soul:
âI had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it.â
âI never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught.â
âThe fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.â
What was said of John the Baptist might also be said of Joseph Smith: âThere was a man sent from God, whose name was [Joseph]. â¦ He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light,â âthat all men through him might believe.â
I believe. I believe and am sure that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I testify that the living God is our loving Father. I know this because the voice of the Lord has spoken it to me, and so has the voice of His servants, the apostles and prophets, including and beginning with Joseph Smith.
I testify that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, a witness and servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was âblessed to open the last dispensation,â and we are blessed that he did.
The Lord commanded Oliver and all of us, âStand by my servant Joseph, faithfully.â I testify that the Lord stands by His servant Joseph and the Restoration wrought through him.
Joseph Smith is now part of that heavenly priesthood of which he spoke. As he promised his friend, he is not far away from us, and on the other side of the veil, he is still working with us, and with a power greatly increased, to roll on this kingdom. With joy and thanksgiving, I raise my voice in âpraise to the man who communed with Jehovah.â And above all, praise to Jehovah, who communed with that man! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

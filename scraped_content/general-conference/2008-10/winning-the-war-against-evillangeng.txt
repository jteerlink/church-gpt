Let Him Do It with Simplicity
By Elder James J. Hamula
October 2008

My dear brethren of the Aaronic Priesthood, these are your days! Do not squander them! Be sober! Take "the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall "¦ quench all the fiery darts of the wicked." Then "fight the good fight of faith." And when you have done all, "stand" still and "see the salvation of the Lord." I assure you that His salvation will come, delivering you and yours from every evil. I so testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

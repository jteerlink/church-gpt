Let Him Do It with Simplicity
By Elder Jeffrey R. Holland
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
October 2008

My beloved brothers and sisters, I testify of angels, both the heavenly and the mortal kind. In doing so I am testifying that God never leaves us alone, never leaves us unaided in the challenges that we face. "[Nor] will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man [or woman or child] upon the face thereof to be saved." On occasions, global or personal, we may feel we are distanced from God, shut out from heaven, lost, alone in dark and dreary places. Often enough that distress can be of our own making, but even then the Father of us all is watching and assisting. And always there are those angels who come and go all around us, seen and unseen, known and unknown, mortal and immortal.
May we all believe more readily in, and have more gratitude for, the Lord"s promise as contained in one of President Monson"s favorite scriptures: "I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, "¦ my Spirit shall be in your [heart], and mine angels round about you, to bear you up." In the process of praying for those angels to attend us, may we all try to be a little more angelic ourselves"with a kind word, a strong arm, a declaration of faith and "the covenant wherewith [we] have covenanted." Perhaps then we can be emissaries sent from God when someone, perhaps a Primary child, is crying, "Darkness "¦ afraid "¦ river "¦ alone." To this end I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

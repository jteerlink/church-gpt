Let Him Do It with Simplicity

President Heber  J. Grant once said, "From my earliest recollections, from the days of Brigham Young until now, I have listened to men standing in the pulpit "¦ urging the people not to run into debt; and I believe that the great majority of all our troubles today is caused through the failure to carry out that counsel" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1921, 3).
One of the better ways to simplify our lives is to follow the counsel we have so often received to live within our income, stay out of debt, and save for a rainy day. We should practice and increase our habits of thrift, industry, economy, and frugality. Members of a well-managed family do not pay interest; they earn it.
Thoreau"s final necessity was fuel. We have been hearing a lot about fuel and energy"about their high cost and limited supply, our unsafe and unpredictable dependence on their suppliers, and the need for new and sustainable sources of energy. I leave the discussion of these complicated issues to leaders of government and industry. The fuel I want to discuss is spiritual fuel.
The Lord has given us a beautiful plan about how we can return to Him, but the completion of our mortal journey requires spiritual fuel. We want to emulate the five wise virgins, who had stored sufficient fuel to accompany the bridegroom when he came (see Matthew 25:6"10). What is required to maintain a sufficient store of spiritual fuel? We must acquire knowledge of God"s eternal plan and our role in it, and then, by living righteously, surrendering our will to the will of the Lord, we receive the promised blessings.
As Elder William  R. Bradford taught at this pulpit: "In righteousness there is great simplicity. In every case that confronts us in life there is either a right way or a wrong way to proceed. If we choose the right way, we are sustained in our actions by the principles of righteousness, in the which there is power from the heavens. If we choose the wrong way and act on that choice, there is no such heavenly promise or power, and we are alone and are destined to fail" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1999, 109; or Ensign, Nov. 1999, 85).
Just before Thoreau died, he was asked if he had made peace with God. He replied, "I was not aware we had ever quarreled" (in Mardy Grothe, comp., Viva la Repartee [2005], 181).
In our search to obtain relief from the stresses of life, may we earnestly seek ways to simplify our lives. May we comply with the inspired counsel and direction the Lord has given us in the great plan of happiness. May we be worthy to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost and follow the guidance of the Spirit as we navigate this mortal journey. May we prepare ourselves to accomplish the ultimate purpose of this mortal test"to return and live with our Heavenly Father"is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
